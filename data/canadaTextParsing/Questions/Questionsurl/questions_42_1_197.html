Direction provided to him verbally by the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) [General Rick Hillier] emphasized that Afghan detainees were to be transferred to Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) as far forward in the field and as rapidly as possible; indeed, that their transfer from CF to ANSF custody was to be measured in terms of ‚Äúminutes to hours.‚Äù, does the government consider that this constituted an instruction by General Hillier to circumvent the formal ‚Äúdetainee‚Äù system with a ‚ÄúPUC‚Äù practice? </td>
